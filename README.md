# What should I know?
Currently, you can only run ScopeApp on a Raspbian build from Feb 2020 or earlier.  This is being investigated, but it is understood that it is due to an XVideo implementation issue on later Raspbian builds.  

You'll obviously need the hardware mod list if you build real hardware.  In particular, there are a few component value changes and modwires required to the PCB and these have not yet been committed to the repository.  I can provide this upon request (it hasn't been compiled yet) - please send me an email (see my GitHub profile).
